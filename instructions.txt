Instructions:

To run a remote solver server, simply run the remote-solver with no command line arguments:

./remote-solver

Calling the remote-solver with one command line argument will search local cache for a corresponding Results pickle file, then query the remote solver server at the address specified in the .server-config file.

Configuration information for the remote solver can be found in the file .server-config, including:
	the address of the remote server to query
	the path to the local cache
	the port the server will listen on
	a security token (optional)
	a cache-only flag

	If any value is entered for the cache-only flag, the server will only return files currently existing in the cache. No new simulations will be run.
